Next KISS Package Manager
________________________________________________________________________________

The at-some-point-in-the-future replacement for the current POSIX shell
package manager written in C99.


Dependencies
________________________________________________________________________________

Required:

- C99 compiler.
- Various POSIX.1-2008 interfaces.

Optional:

- libcurl (if absent, download support is not compiled)

- The 'nostrip' file will be replaced with a more thought out alternative. This
  current method breaks when user hooks are used at runtime to modify cache 
  directories.
