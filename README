Next KISS Package Manager
________________________________________________________________________________

The at-some-point-in-the-future replacement for the current POSIX shell
package manager written in C99.


Dependencies
________________________________________________________________________________

Required:

- C99 compiler
- Various POSIX.1-2008 interfaces
- libcurl


Compilation
________________________________________________________________________________

$ CFLAGS="" LDFLAGS="" CPPFLAGS="" ./make


Changes from the shell version (present and future)
________________________________________________________________________________

- The 'alternatives' action will be renamed to 'alt' to make the long form
  action name easier to use ('a' will still work as it did).

- The 'nostrip' file will be replaced with a more thought out alternative. This
  current method breaks when user hooks are used at runtime to modify cache
  directories.

- KISS_HOOK will not be implemented. A new means of configuration will be
  added to fill this gap.

- KISS_DEBUG may be changed to display verbose messages among other things.

- ...
